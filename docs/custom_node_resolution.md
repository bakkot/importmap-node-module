# Custom node module resolution

`@jsenv/importmap-node-module` uses a custom node module resolution

It behaves as Node.js with one big change:

**A node module will not be found if it is outside your project directory.**

We do this because import map are used on the web where a file outside project directory cannot be reached.

In practice, it has no impact because node modules are inside your project directory. If they are not, ensure all your dependencies are in your `package.json` and re-run `npm install`.
